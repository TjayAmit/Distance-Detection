# Social Distancing Monitoring System - Object Detection

CAPSTONE PROJECT

Due to exponential growth of covid case in the country and fast spreading virus world wide the World health organization advise countries to implement lockdowns, social distancing and usage of face mask. As our country approve the policy the local goverment has hard time to really monitor social distancing in many areas so we developt this system to help local goverment and establishment in monitoring social distancing, the idea is whenever in a area the the system will detect violation of social disctancing with rule of less than 1 meter the system will notify and advice the people to strictly follow social distancing using a audio recorded. 

If the advice is ignore it is for the establishment employee or security to handle the situation in the areas. Our system is focus only in detecting violation in order to help goverment fight the continues growth of the covid cases.
